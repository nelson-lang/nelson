<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Let's Nelson! matrix language for engineering and scientific application</summary>
    <description>
Nelson is an array programming language providing a powerful open computing environment for
engineering and scientific applications using modern C/C++ libraries (Boost, Eigen, …)
and others state of art numerical libraries.

It has sophisticated data structures (including cell, struct, linear systems, …),
an interpreter and a high level programming language.

Nelson has been developed to be an open/modular system where an user can define
these own data types and operations on these data types by using overload.

## Features

- Types managed by Nelson:

  - double and double complex: scalar, vector, matrix 2D, N dimensions array, sparse matrix.
  - single and single complex: scalar, vector, matrix 2D, N dimensions array, sparse matrix.
  - logical: scalar, vector, matrix 2D, N dimensions array, sparse matrix.
  - character array (UNICODE supported).
  - string array (UNICODE supported).
  - integers 8, 16, 32, 64 signed and unsigned: scalar, vector, matrix 2D, N dimensions array.
  - handle objects.

- 2D and 3D plotting with high-level plot commands.

- `OpenMP` and `SIMD` extensions used.

- Fast Fourrier Transformation functions based on FFTW and MKL wrapper.

- SLICOT (Subroutine Library in Systems and Control Theory) interfaces (optional).

- Message Passing Interface (MPI): functions for parallel computing.

- JSON decode/encode data support.

- HDF5 high-level functions I/O,

- HDF5 used as default data file format (.nh5) load/save workspace,

- MAT-file compatible load/save workspace,

- Foreign Function Interface C/Fortran.

- Interfacing C/C++ or Fortran with Nelson (build and load external code on the fly).

- Python engine.

- Julia engine.

- MEX C API compatibility.

- Nelson Engine API for C (compatible with MEX Engine). Call Nelson from your C code as engine.

- RESTful API web service.

- Inter-process communication between Nelson's process.

- The QML engine enables nelson programs to display and manipulate graphical content using Qt's QML framework.

- Component Object Model (COM) client interface: binary-interface standard for software components on Windows.

- Write/Read xlsx files on Windows using COM.

- Embedded Nelson code editor.

- Help engine:

  Generate help files using Nelson dedicated functions.
  View your generated help files as html, markdown, pdf, gitbook or directly in Nelson help viewer.

- Tests engine:

  Validate your algorithm using Nelson dedicated functions.
  Export the test results under the xUnit reports format.

- Profiling and Code coverage tools for Nelson's language:

  Nelson has a built-in profiler that is very useful to profile your code and find out what script or function is taking the most time.

- [Nelson cloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nelson-cloud):
  Instant access to Nelson anywhere from an web browser.

- Module skeleton to extend Nelson available here:

  - [template macros and builtin](https://github.com/nelson-lang/module_skeleton),
  - [basic template macros only](https://github.com/nelson-lang/module_skeleton_basic).

- Nelson Modules Manager (nmm) : package manager for Nelson
