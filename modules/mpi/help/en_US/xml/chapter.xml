    <p
    >In the world of parallel computing, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the de facto
      standard for implementing programs on multiple processors.</p>
    <p
    >This module provides functions to initialize, manage, and finalize MPI environments, as well
      as to perform communication between processes, both point-to-point and collective.</p>
    <p
    >It enables Nelson programs to run efficiently on distributed-memory systems and clusters.</p>
