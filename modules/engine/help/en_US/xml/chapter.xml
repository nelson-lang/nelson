  <chapter_description>
    <p>The Engine module manages the execution environment of Nelson itself.</p>
    <p
    >It provides mechanisms to handle program startup and shutdown behavior, command-line integration, and runtime modes.</p>
    <p
    >This includes support for user-defined initialization and termination scripts, platform-specific system requirements, and interpreter directives for cross-platform script execution.</p>
    <p
    >It serves as the core interface between Nelson and the underlying operating system, ensuring flexible configuration and smooth control over how the software is launched and operated.</p>
