        <p
    >The Error Manager module provides the mechanisms for handling errors and warnings in Nelson.</p>
        <p
    >It defines how exceptions are created, raised, and rethrown, as well as how diagnostic information can be retrieved after an error or warning occurs.</p>
        <p
    >This module ensures that users can manage execution flow in the presence of failures, capture meaningful error reports, and display warnings without interrupting program execution.</p>
        <p
    >It forms the foundation for robust error handling and debugging in Nelson applications.</p>
