    *   Float operations produce float results.
    *   Double operations produce double results.
    *   Mixtures of float and double operations produce double results.
    *   Integer operations (of any kind) produce int results -
    *     the question is what type do these objects get promoted too?  The
    *     answer is a signed int (32 bits).
    *   Mixtures of real and complex operations produce complex results.
    *   Integer constants are 32 bit by default
    *   Float constants are 64 bit by default
    *   Division operations lead to promotion
    *   Character types are automatically (demoted) to 32 bit integers.
    *
    *   The way to accomplish this is as follows: compute the larger
    *   of the types of A and B.  Call this type t_max.  If t_max
    *   is not an integer type, promote both types to this type.
    *   If t_max is an integer type, promote both objects to an NLS_INT32.
    *   If this is a division operation or a matrix operation, promote both
    *    objects to an NLS_DOUBLE64!
