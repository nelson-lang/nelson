     <p
    >The Interpreter Functions module provides the core language constructs and control mechanisms that define the execution flow in Nelson.</p>
     <p
    >It includes essential elements such as loops, conditional branching, error handling, and function declarations.</p>
     <p
    >The module also offers tools for parsing code, working with keywords, and managing recursion limits.</p>
     <p
    >Together, these features establish the fundamental syntax and semantics of the Nelson language, enabling users to write structured, dynamic, and reliable programs.</p>
