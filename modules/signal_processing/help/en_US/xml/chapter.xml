    >The Signal Processing module provides tools for analyzing and manipulating sampled signals in Nelson.</p>
        <p
    >It includes windowing functions, digital filtering, cross-correlation, and conversions between magnitude, power, and decibel representations.</p>
        <p
    >The module also supports transformation between zero-pole representations and transfer functions, enabling efficient design and analysis of discrete-time signal processing systems.</p>
