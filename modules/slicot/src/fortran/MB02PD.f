C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Mode Parameters
C
C     FACT    CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A
C             is supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A
C             should be equilibrated before it is factored.
C             = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form
C                     of A. If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
C                     equilibrated with scaling factors given by R
C                     and C. A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
C             = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
C             = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary,
C                     then copied to AF and factored.
C
C     TRANS   CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies the form of the system of equations as follows:
C             = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose);

C             this array contains the matrix A scaled as follows:
C             EQUED = 'R':  A := diag(R) * A;

C             (LDAF,N)
C             If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry

C             If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
C             the leading N-by-N part of this array contains the factors

C             equilibrated matrix A (see the description of A for the
C             form of the equilibrated matrix).
C
C     LDAF    (input) INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
C
C     IPIV    (input or output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)

C             it must contain the pivot indices from the factorization
C             A = P*L*U as computed by DGETRF; row i of the matrix was
C             interchanged with row IPIV(i).
C             If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
C             it contains the pivot indices from the factorization
C             A = P*L*U of the original matrix A.

C             A = P*L*U of the equilibrated matrix A.
C
C     EQUED   (input or output) CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies the form of equilibration that was done as
C             follows:
C             = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N');
C             = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied
C                     by diag(R);
C             = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been
C                     postmultiplied by diag(C);
C             = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has
C                     been replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
C             EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is
C             an output argument.
C
C     R       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
C             multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C',
C             R is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
C             otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
C             EQUED = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.
C
C     C       (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B',
C             A is multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N'
C             or 'R', C is not accessed.  C is an input argument if
C             FACT = 'F'; otherwise, C is an output argument.  If
C             FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must
C             be positive.
C
C     B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
C             (LDB,NRHS)
C             On entry, the leading N-by-NRHS part of this array must
C             contain the right-hand side matrix B.
C             On exit,
C             if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
C             if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B', the leading
C             N-by-NRHS part of this array contains diag(R)*B;
C             if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', the leading
C             N-by-NRHS part of this array contains diag(C)*B.
C
C     LDB     INTEGER

C
C     X       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
C             If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the leading N-by-NRHS part of
C             this array contains the solution matrix X to the original
C             system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on
C             exit if EQUED .NE. 'N', and the solution to the
C             equilibrated system is inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and
C             EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or inv(diag(R))*X if TRANS = 'T' or
C             'C' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B'.
C
C     LDX     (input) INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
C
C     RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the
C             matrix A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less
C             than the machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0),
C             the matrix is singular to working precision.  This
C             condition is indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
C             For efficiency reasons, RCOND is computed only when the
C             matrix A is factored, i.e., for FACT = 'N' or 'E'.  For
C             FACT = 'F', RCOND is not used, but it is assumed that it
C             has been computed and checked before the routine call.
C
C     FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
C             The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
C             X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
C             If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j),
C             FERR(j) is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of
C             the largest element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the
C             magnitude of the largest element in X(j).  The estimate
C             is as reliable as the estimate for RCOND, and is almost
C             always a slight overestimate of the true error.
C
C     BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
C             The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
C             vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
C             any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
C
C     Workspace
C
C     IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (N)
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)
C             On entry, if FACT = 'F', DWORK(1) contains the reciprocal
C             pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U), computed previously
C             by this routine, with FACT <> 'N', for the same matrix A.
C             On exit, DWORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth
C             factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is
C             used. If DWORK(1) is much less than 1, then the stability
C             of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
C             could be poor. This also means that the solution X,
C             condition estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR
C             could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
C             0 < INFO <= N, then DWORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot
C             growth factor for the leading INFO columns of A.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value;
C             > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
C                   <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
C                          has been completed, but the factor U is
C                          exactly singular, so the solution and error
C                          bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is
C                          returned.
C                   = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than
C                          machine precision, meaning that the matrix is
C                          singular to working precision.  Nevertheless,
C                          the solution and error bounds are computed
C                          because there are a number of situations
C                          where the computed solution can be more
C                          accurate than the value of RCOND would
C                          suggest.
C             The positive values for INFO are set only when the
C             matrix A is factored, i.e., for FACT = 'N' or 'E'.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The following steps are performed:
C
C     1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
C        the system:
C
C        TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
C        TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
C        TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
C
C        Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
C        scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
C        overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B
C        (if TRANS='N') or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').
C
C     2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
C        the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
C           A = P * L * U,
C        where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower triangular
C        matrix, and U is upper triangular.
C
C     3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the
C        routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form
C        of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.
C        If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
C        precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
C        still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
C        described below.
C
C     4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
C        of A.
C
C     5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed
C        solution matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error
C        estimates for it.
C
C     6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
C        diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
C        that it solves the original system before equilibration.
