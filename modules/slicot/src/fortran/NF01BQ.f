C     PURPOSE
C
C     To determine a vector x which solves the system of linear
C     equations
C
C           J*x = b ,     D*x = 0 ,
C
C     in the least squares sense, where J is an m-by-n matrix,
C     D is an n-by-n diagonal matrix, and b is an m-vector. The matrix J
C     is the current Jacobian of a nonlinear least squares problem,
C     provided in a compressed form by SLICOT Library routine NF01BD.
C     It is assumed that a block QR factorization, with column pivoting,
C     of J is available, that is, J*P = Q*R, where P is a permutation
C     matrix, Q has orthogonal columns, and R is an upper triangular
C     matrix with diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude for each
C     block, as returned by SLICOT Library routine NF01BS. The routine
C     NF01BQ needs the upper triangle of R in compressed form, the
C     permutation matrix P, and the first n components of Q'*b
C     (' denotes the transpose). The system J*x = b, D*x = 0, is then
C     equivalent to
C
C           R*z = Q'*b ,  P'*D*P*z = 0 ,                             (1)
C
C     where x = P*z. If this system does not have full rank, then an
C     approximate least squares solution is obtained (see METHOD).
C     On output, NF01BQ also provides an upper triangular matrix S
C     such that
C
C           P'*(J'*J + D*D)*P = S'*S .
C
C     The system (1) is equivalent to S*z = c , where c contains the
C     first n components of the vector obtained by applying to
C     [ (Q'*b)'  0 ]' the transformations which triangularized
C     [ R'  P'*D*P ]', getting S.
C
C     The matrix R has the following structure
C
C         /   R_1    0    ..   0   |   L_1   \
C         |    0    R_2   ..   0   |   L_2   |
C         |    :     :    ..   :   |    :    | ,
C         |    0     0    ..  R_l  |   L_l   |
C         \    0     0    ..   0   |  R_l+1  /
C
C     where the submatrices R_k, k = 1:l, have the same order BSN,
C     and R_k, k = 1:l+1, are square and upper triangular. This matrix
C     is stored in the compressed form
C
C              /   R_1  |   L_1   \
C              |   R_2  |   L_2   |
C       Rc =   |    :   |    :    | ,
C              |   R_l  |   L_l   |
C              \    X   |  R_l+1  /
C
C     where the submatrix X is irrelevant. The matrix S has the same
C     structure as R, and its diagonal blocks are denoted by S_k,
C     k = 1:l+1.
C
C     If l <= 1, then the full upper triangle of the matrix R is stored.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Mode Parameters
C
C     COND    CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether the condition of the matrices S_k should
C             be estimated, as follows:
C             = 'E' :  use incremental condition estimation and store
C                      the numerical rank of S_k in the array entry
C                      RANKS(k), for k = 1:l+1;
C             = 'N' :  do not use condition estimation, but check the
C                      diagonal entries of S_k for zero values;
C             = 'U' :  use the ranks already stored in RANKS(1:l+1).
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The order of the matrix R.  N = BN*BSN + ST >= 0.
C             (See parameter description below.)
C
C     IPAR    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (LIPAR)
C             The integer parameters describing the structure of the
C             matrix R, as follows:
C             IPAR(1) must contain ST, the number of columns of the
C                     submatrices L_k and the order of R_l+1.  ST >= 0.
C             IPAR(2) must contain BN, the number of blocks, l, in the
C                     block diagonal part of R.  BN >= 0.
C             IPAR(3) must contain BSM, the number of rows of the blocks
C                     R_k, k = 1:l.  BSM >= 0.
C             IPAR(4) must contain BSN, the number of columns of the
C                     blocks R_k, k = 1:l.  BSN >= 0.
C             BSM is not used by this routine, but assumed equal to BSN.
C
C     LIPAR   (input) INTEGER
C             The length of the array IPAR.  LIPAR >= 4.
C
C     R       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDR, NC)
C             where NC = N if BN <= 1, and NC = BSN+ST, if BN > 1.
C             On entry, the leading N-by-NC part of this array must
C             contain the (compressed) representation (Rc) of the upper
C             triangular matrix R. If BN > 1, the submatrix X in Rc is
C             not referenced. The zero strict lower triangles of R_k,
C             k = 1:l+1, need not be set. If BN <= 1 or BSN = 0, then
C             the full upper triangle of R must be stored.
C             On exit, the full upper triangles of R_k, k = 1:l+1, and
C             L_k, k = 1:l, are unaltered, and the strict lower
C             triangles of R_k, k = 1:l+1, contain the corresponding
C             strict upper triangles (transposed) of the upper
C             triangular matrix S.
C             If BN <= 1 or BSN = 0, then the transpose of the strict
C             upper triangle of S is stored in the strict lower triangle
C             of R.
C
C     LDR     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of the array R.  LDR >= MAX(1,N).
C
C     IPVT    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
C             This array must define the permutation matrix P such that
C             J*P = Q*R. Column j of P is column IPVT(j) of the identity
C             matrix.
C
C     DIAG    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             This array must contain the diagonal elements of the
C             matrix D.
C
C     QTB     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             This array must contain the first n elements of the
C             vector Q'*b.
C
C     RANKS   (input or output) INTEGER array, dimension (r), where
C             r = BN + 1,  if ST > 0, BSN > 0, and BN > 1;
C             r = BN,      if ST = 0 and BSN > 0;
C             r = 1,       if ST > 0 and ( BSN = 0 or BN <= 1 );
C             r = 0,       if ST = 0 and BSN = 0.
C             On entry, if COND = 'U' and N > 0, this array must contain
C             the numerical ranks of the submatrices S_k, k = 1:l(+1).
C             On exit, if COND = 'E' or 'N' and N > 0, this array
C             contains the numerical ranks of the submatrices S_k,
C             k = 1:l(+1), estimated according to the value of COND.
C
C     X       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             This array contains the least squares solution of the
C             system J*x = b, D*x = 0.
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             If COND = 'E', the tolerance to be used for finding the
C             ranks of the submatrices S_k. If the user sets TOL > 0,
C             then the given value of TOL is used as a lower bound for
C             the reciprocal condition number;  a (sub)matrix whose
C             estimated condition number is less than 1/TOL is
C             considered to be of full rank.  If the user sets TOL <= 0,
C             then an implicitly computed, default tolerance, defined by
C             TOLDEF = N*EPS,  is used instead, where EPS is the machine
C             precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).
C             This parameter is not relevant if COND = 'U' or 'N'.
C
C     Workspace
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
C             On exit, the first N elements of this array contain the
C             diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix S, and
C             the next N elements contain the solution z.
C             If BN > 1 and BSN > 0, the elements 2*N+1 : 2*N+ST*(N-ST)

C             matrix S.
C
C     LDWORK  INTEGER
C             The length of the array DWORK.
C             LDWORK >= 2*N,              if BN <= 1 or  BSN = 0 and
C                                                        COND <> 'E';
C             LDWORK >= 4*N,              if BN <= 1 or  BSN = 0 and
C                                                        COND =  'E';

C             LDWORK >= ST*(N-ST) + 2*N + 2*MAX(BSN,ST),
C                                         if BN >  1 and BSN > 0 and

C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     Standard plane rotations are used to annihilate the elements of
C     the diagonal matrix D, updating the upper triangular matrix R
C     and the first n elements of the vector Q'*b. A basic least squares
C     solution is computed. The computations exploit the special
C     structure and storage scheme of the matrix R. If one or more of
C     the submatrices S_k, k = 1:l+1, is singular, then the computed
C     result is not the basic least squares solution for the whole
C     problem, but a concatenation of (least squares) solutions of the
C     individual subproblems involving R_k, k = 1:l+1 (with adapted
C     right hand sides).

C     FURTHER COMMENTS
C
C     This routine is a structure-exploiting, LAPACK-based modification
C     of QRSOLV from the MINPACK package [1], and with optional
C     condition estimation.
C     The option COND = 'U' is useful when dealing with several
C     right-hand side vectors.
