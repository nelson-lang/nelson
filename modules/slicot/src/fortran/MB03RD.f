C     PURPOSE
C
C     To reduce a matrix A in real Schur form to a block-diagonal form
C     using well-conditioned non-orthogonal similarity transformations.
C     The condition numbers of the transformations used for reduction
C     are roughly bounded by PMAX, where PMAX is a given value.
C     The transformations are optionally postmultiplied in a given
C     matrix X. The real Schur form is optionally ordered, so that
C     clustered eigenvalues are grouped in the same block.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Mode Parameters
C
C     JOBX    CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether or not the transformations are
C             accumulated, as follows:
C             = 'N':  The transformations are not accumulated;
C             = 'U':  The transformations are accumulated in X (the
C                     given matrix X is updated).
C
C     SORT    CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether or not the diagonal blocks of the real
C             Schur form are reordered, as follows:
C             = 'N':  The diagonal blocks are not reordered;
C             = 'S':  The diagonal blocks are reordered before each
C                     step of reduction, so that clustered eigenvalues
C                     appear in the same block;
C             = 'C':  The diagonal blocks are not reordered, but the
C                     "closest-neighbour" strategy is used instead of
C                     the standard "closest to the mean" strategy
C                     (see METHOD);
C             = 'B':  The diagonal blocks are reordered before each
C                     step of reduction, and the "closest-neighbour"
C                     strategy is used (see METHOD).
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The order of the matrices A and X.  N >= 0.
C
C     PMAX    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             An upper bound for the infinity norm of elementary
C             submatrices of the individual transformations used for
C             reduction (see METHOD).  PMAX >= 1.0D0.
C
C     A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
C             On entry, the leading N-by-N part of this array must
C             contain the matrix A to be block-diagonalized, in real
C             Schur form.
C             On exit, the leading N-by-N part of this array contains
C             the computed block-diagonal matrix, in real Schur
C             canonical form. The non-diagonal blocks are set to zero.
C
C     LDA     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array A.  LDA >= MAX(1,N).
C
C     X       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,N)
C             On entry, if JOBX = 'U', the leading N-by-N part of this
C             array must contain a given matrix X.
C             On exit, if JOBX = 'U', the leading N-by-N part of this
C             array contains the product of the given matrix X and the
C             transformation matrix that reduced A to block-diagonal
C             form. The transformation matrix is itself a product of
C             non-orthogonal similarity transformations having elements
C             with magnitude less than or equal to PMAX.
C             If JOBX = 'N', this array is not referenced.
C
C     LDX     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array X.
C             LDX >= 1,        if JOBX = 'N';
C             LDX >= MAX(1,N), if JOBX = 'U'.
C
C     NBLCKS  (output) INTEGER
C             The number of diagonal blocks of the matrix A.
C
C     BLSIZE  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
C             The first NBLCKS elements of this array contain the orders
C             of the resulting diagonal blocks of the matrix A.
C
C     WR,     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION arrays, dimension (N)

C             respectively, of the eigenvalues of the matrix A.
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The tolerance to be used in the ordering of the diagonal
C             blocks of the real Schur form matrix.
C             If the user sets TOL > 0, then the given value of TOL is
C             used as an absolute tolerance: a block i and a temporarily
C             fixed block 1 (the first block of the current trailing
C             submatrix to be reduced) are considered to belong to the
C             same cluster if their eigenvalues satisfy
C
C               | lambda_1 - lambda_i | <= TOL.
C
C             If the user sets TOL < 0, then the given value of TOL is
C             used as a relative tolerance: a block i and a temporarily
C             fixed block 1 are considered to belong to the same cluster
C             if their eigenvalues satisfy, for j = 1, ..., N,
C
C               | lambda_1 - lambda_i | <= | TOL | * max | lambda_j |.
C
C             If the user sets TOL = 0, then an implicitly computed,
C             default tolerance, defined by TOL = SQRT( SQRT( EPS ) )
C             is used instead, as a relative tolerance, where EPS is
C             the machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).
C             If SORT = 'N' or 'C', this parameter is not referenced.
C

C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     Consider first that SORT = 'N'. Let
C
C            ( A    A   )
C            (  11   12 )
C        A = (          ),
C            ( 0    A   )
C            (       22 )
C
C     be the given matrix in real Schur form, where initially A   is the
C                                                              11
C     first diagonal block of dimension 1-by-1 or 2-by-2. An attempt is
C     made to compute a transformation matrix X of the form
C
C            ( I   P )
C        X = (       )                                               (1)
C            ( 0   I )
C
C     (partitioned as A), so that
C
C                 ( A     0  )
C         -1      (  11      )
C        X  A X = (          ),
C                 ( 0    A   )
C                 (       22 )
C
C     and the elements of P do not exceed the value PMAX in magnitude.
C     An adaptation of the standard method for solving Sylvester
C     equations [1], which controls the magnitude of the individual
C     elements of the computed solution [2], is used to obtain matrix P.
C     When this attempt failed, an 1-by-1 (or 2-by-2) diagonal block of
C     A  , whose eigenvalue(s) is (are) the closest to the mean of those
C      22
C     of A   is selected, and moved by orthogonal similarity
C         11
C     transformations in the leading position of A  ; the moved diagonal
C                                                 22
C     block is then added to the block A  , increasing its order by 1
C                                       11
C     (or 2). Another attempt is made to compute a suitable
C     transformation matrix X with the new definitions of the blocks A
C                                                                     11
C     and A  . After a successful transformation matrix X has been
C          22
C     obtained, it postmultiplies the current transformation matrix
C     (if JOBX = 'U'), and the whole procedure is repeated for the
C     matrix A  .
C             22
C
C     When SORT = 'S', the diagonal blocks of the real Schur form are
C     reordered before each step of the reduction, so that each cluster
C     of eigenvalues, defined as specified in the definition of TOL,
C     appears in adjacent blocks. The blocks for each cluster are merged
C     together, and the procedure described above is applied to the
C     larger blocks. Using the option SORT = 'S' will usually provide
C     better efficiency than the standard option (SORT = 'N'), proposed
C     in [2], because there could be no or few unsuccessful attempts
C     to compute individual transformation matrices X of the form (1).
C     However, the resulting dimensions of the blocks are usually
C     larger; this could make subsequent calculations less efficient.
C
C     When SORT = 'C' or 'B', the procedure is similar to that for
C     SORT = 'N' or 'S', respectively, but the block of A   whose
C                                                        22
C     eigenvalue(s) is (are) the closest to those of A   (not to their
C                                                     11
C     mean) is selected and moved to the leading position of A  . This
C                                                             22
C     is called the "closest-neighbour" strategy.

C     The algorithm usually requires 0(N ) operations, but 0(N ) are
C     possible in the worst case, when all diagonal blocks in the real
C     Schur form of A are 1-by-1, and the matrix cannot be diagonalized
C     by well-conditioned transformations.
C
C     FURTHER COMMENTS
C
C     The individual non-orthogonal transformation matrices used in the
C     reduction of A to a block-diagonal form have condition numbers
C     of the order PMAX. This does not guarantee that their product
C     is well-conditioned enough. The routine can be easily modified to
C     provide estimates for the condition numbers of the clusters of
C     eigenvalues.
