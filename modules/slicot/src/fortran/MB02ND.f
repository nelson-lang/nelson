C     PURPOSE
C
C     To solve the Total Least Squares (TLS) problem using a Partial
C     Singular Value Decomposition (PSVD) approach.
C     The TLS problem assumes an overdetermined set of linear equations
C     AX = B, where both the data matrix A as well as the observation
C     matrix B are inaccurate. The routine also solves determined and
C     underdetermined sets of equations by computing the minimum norm
C     solution.
C     It is assumed that all preprocessing measures (scaling, coordinate
C     transformations, whitening, ... ) of the data have been performed
C     in advance.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     M       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of rows in the data matrix A and the
C             observation matrix B.  M >= 0.
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of columns in the data matrix A.  N >= 0.
C
C     L       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of columns in the observation matrix B.
C             L >= 0.
C
C     RANK    (input/output) INTEGER
C             On entry, if RANK < 0, then the rank of the TLS
C             approximation [A+DA|B+DB] (r say) is computed by the
C             routine.
C             Otherwise, RANK must specify the value of r.
C             RANK <= min(M,N).
C             On exit, if RANK < 0 on entry and INFO = 0, then RANK
C             contains the computed rank of the TLS approximation
C             [A+DA|B+DB].
C             Otherwise, the user-supplied value of RANK may be
C             changed by the routine on exit if the RANK-th and the
C             (RANK+1)-th singular values of C = [A|B] are considered
C             to be equal, or if the upper triangular matrix F (as
C             defined in METHOD) is (numerically) singular.
C
C     THETA   (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             On entry, if RANK < 0, then the rank of the TLS
C             approximation [A+DA|B+DB] is computed using THETA as
C             (min(M,N+L) - d), where d is the number of singular
C             values of [A|B] <= THETA. THETA >= 0.0.
C             Otherwise, THETA is an initial estimate (t say) for
C             computing a lower bound on the RANK largest singular
C             values of [A|B]. If THETA < 0.0 on entry however, then
C             t is computed by the routine.
C             On exit, if RANK >= 0 on entry, then THETA contains the
C             computed bound such that precisely RANK singular values
C             of C = [A|B] are greater than THETA + TOL.
C             Otherwise, THETA is unchanged.
C
C     C       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDC,N+L)
C             On entry, the leading M-by-(N+L) part of this array must
C             contain the matrices A and B. Specifically, the first N
C             columns must contain the data matrix A and the last L
C             columns the observation matrix B (right-hand sides).
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, the first N+L components of the
C             columns of this array whose index i corresponds with
C             INUL(i) = .TRUE., are the possibly transformed (N+L-RANK)
C             base vectors of the right singular subspace corresponding
C             to the singular values of C = [A|B] which are less than or
C             equal to THETA. Specifically, if L = 0, or if RANK = 0 and
C             IWARN <> 2, these vectors are indeed the base vectors
C             above. Otherwise, these vectors form the matrix V2,
C             transformed as described in Step 4 of the PTLS algorithm
C             (see METHOD). The TLS solution is computed from these
C             vectors. The other columns of array C contain no useful
C             information.
C
C     LDC     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array C.  LDC >= max(1,M,N+L).
C
C     X       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,L)
C             If INFO = 0, the leading N-by-L part of this array
C             contains the solution X to the TLS problem specified by
C             A and B.
C
C     LDX     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
C
C     Q       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
C             (max(1,2*min(M,N+L)-1))
C             This array contains the partially diagonalized bidiagonal
C             matrix J computed from C, at the moment that the desired
C             singular subspace has been found. Specifically, the
C             leading p = min(M,N+L) entries of Q contain the diagonal
C             elements q(1),q(2),...,q(p) and the entries Q(p+1),Q(p+2),
C             ...,Q(2*p-1) contain the superdiagonal elements e(1),e(2),
C             ...,e(p-1) of J.
C
C     INUL    (output) LOGICAL array, dimension (N+L)
C             The indices of the elements of this array with value
C             .TRUE. indicate the columns in C containing the base
C             vectors of the right singular subspace of C from which
C             the TLS solution has been computed.
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             This parameter defines the multiplicity of singular values
C             by considering all singular values within an interval of
C             length TOL as coinciding. TOL is used in checking how many
C             singular values are less than or equal to THETA. Also in
C             computing an appropriate upper bound THETA by a bisection
C             method, TOL is used as a stopping criterion defining the
C             minimum (absolute) subinterval width. TOL is also taken
C             as an absolute tolerance for negligible elements in the
C             QR/QL iterations. If the user sets TOL to be less than or
C             equal to 0, then the tolerance is taken as specified in
C             SLICOT Library routine MB04YD document.
C
C     RELTOL  DOUBLE PRECISION
C             This parameter specifies the minimum relative width of an
C             interval. When an interval is narrower than TOL, or than
C             RELTOL times the larger (in magnitude) endpoint, then it
C             is considered to be sufficiently small and bisection has
C             converged. If the user sets RELTOL to be less than
C             BASE * EPS, where BASE is machine radix and EPS is machine
C             precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH), then the
C             tolerance is taken as BASE * EPS.
C
C     Workspace
C
C     IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (N+2*L)
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
C             of LDWORK, and DWORK(2) returns the reciprocal of the
C             condition number of the matrix F.
C
C     LDWORK  INTEGER
C             The length of the array DWORK.
C             LDWORK = max(2, max(M,N+L) + 2*min(M,N+L),
C                          min(M,N+L) + LW + max(6*(N+L)-5,
C                                                L*L+max(N+L,3*L)),
C             where
C             LW = (N+L)*(N+L-1)/2,  if M >= N+L,
C             LW = M*(N+L-(M-1)/2),  if M <  N+L.
C             For optimum performance LDWORK should be larger.
C
C             If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed;
C             the routine only calculates the optimal size of the
C             DWORK array, returns this value as the first entry of
C             the DWORK array, and no error message related to LDWORK
C             is issued by XERBLA.
C
C     BWORK   LOGICAL array, dimension (N+L)
C
C     Warning Indicator
C
C     IWARN   INTEGER
C             = 0:  no warnings;
C             = 1:  if the rank of matrix C has been lowered because a
C                   singular value of multiplicity greater than 1 was
C                   found;
C             = 2:  if the rank of matrix C has been lowered because the
C                   upper triangular matrix F is (numerically) singular.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value;
C             = 1:  if the maximum number of QR/QL iteration steps
C                   (30*MIN(M,N)) has been exceeded;
C             = 2:  if the computed rank of the TLS approximation
C                   [A+DA|B+DB] exceeds MIN(M,N). Try increasing the
C                   value of THETA or set the value of RANK to min(M,N).
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The method used is the Partial Total Least Squares (PTLS) approach
C     proposed by Van Huffel and Vandewalle [5].
C
C     Let C = [A|B] denote the matrix formed by adjoining the columns of
C     B to the columns of A on the right.
C
C     Total Least Squares (TLS) definition:
C     -------------------------------------
C
C       Given matrices A and B, find a matrix X satisfying
C
C            (A + DA) X = B + DB,
C
C       where A and DA are M-by-N matrices, B and DB are M-by-L matrices
C       and X is an N-by-L matrix.
C       The solution X must be such that the Frobenius norm of [DA|DB]
C       is a minimum and each column of B + DB is in the range of
C       A + DA. Whenever the solution is not unique, the routine singles
C       out the minimum norm solution X.
C
C     Let V denote the right singular subspace of C. Since the TLS
C     solution can be computed from any orthogonal basis of the subspace
C     of V corresponding to the smallest singular values of C, the
C     Partial Singular Value Decomposition (PSVD) can be used instead of
C     the classical SVD. The dimension of this subspace of V may be
C     determined by the rank of C or by an upper bound for those
C     smallest singular values.
C
C     The PTLS algorithm proceeds as follows (see [2 - 5]):
C
C     Step 1: Bidiagonalization phase
C             -----------------------
C      (a) If M is large enough than N + L, transform C into upper
C          triangular form R by Householder transformations.
C      (b) Transform C (or R) into upper bidiagonal form
C          (p = min(M,N+L)):
C
C                     |q(1) e(1)  0   ...  0   |
C                (0)  | 0   q(2) e(2)      .   |
C               J   = | .                  .   |
C                     | .                e(p-1)|
C                     | 0             ... q(p) |
C
C          if M >= N + L, or lower bidiagonal form:
C
C                     |q(1)  0    0   ...  0     0   |
C                (0)  |e(1) q(2)  0        .     .   |
C               J   = | .                  .     .   |
C                     | .                 q(p)   .   |
C                     | 0             ... e(p-1) q(p)|
C
C          if M < N + L, using Householder transformations.
C          In the second case, transform the matrix to the upper
C          bidiagonal form by applying Givens rotations.
C      (c) Initialize the right singular base matrix with the identity
C          matrix.
C
C     Step 2: Partial diagonalization phase
C             -----------------------------
C     If the upper bound THETA is not given, then compute THETA such
C     that precisely p - RANK singular values (p=min(M,N+L)) of the
C     bidiagonal matrix are less than or equal to THETA, using a
C     bisection method [5]. Diagonalize the given bidiagonal matrix J
C     partially, using either QL iterations (if the upper left diagonal
C     element of the considered bidiagonal submatrix is smaller than the
C     lower right diagonal element) or QR iterations, such that J is
C     split into unreduced bidiagonal submatrices whose singular values
C     are either all larger than THETA or are all less than or equal
C     to THETA. Accumulate the Givens rotations in V.
C
C     Step 3: Back transformation phase
C             -------------------------
C     Apply the Householder transformations of Step 1(b) onto the base
C     vectors of V associated with the bidiagonal submatrices with all
C     singular values less than or equal to THETA.
C
C     Step 4: Computation of F and Y
C             ----------------------
C     Let V2 be the matrix of the columns of V corresponding to the
C     (N + L - RANK) smallest singular values of C.
C     Compute with Householder transformations the matrices F and Y
C     such that:
C
C                       |VH   Y|
C              V2 x Q = |      |
C                       |0    F|
C
C     where Q is an orthogonal matrix, VH is an N-by-(N-RANK) matrix,
C     Y is an N-by-L matrix and F is an L-by-L upper triangular matrix.
C     If F is singular, then reduce the value of RANK by one and repeat
C     Steps 2, 3 and 4.
C
C     Step 5: Computation of the TLS solution
C             -------------------------------
C     If F is non-singular then the solution X is obtained by solving
C     the following equations by forward elimination:
C
C              X F = -Y.
C
C     Notes:
C     If RANK is lowered in Step 4, some additional base vectors must
C     be computed in Step 2. The additional computations are kept to
C     a minimum.
C     If RANK is lowered in Step 4 but the multiplicity of the RANK-th
C     singular value is larger than 1, then the value of RANK is further
C     lowered with its multiplicity defined by the parameter TOL. This
C     is done at the beginning of Step 2 by calling SLICOT Library
C     routine MB03MD (from MB04YD), which estimates THETA using a
C     bisection method. If F in Step 4 is singular, then the computed
C     solution is infinite and hence does not satisfy the second TLS
C     criterion (see TLS definition). For these cases, Golub and
C     Van Loan [1] claim that the TLS problem has no solution. The
C     properties of these so-called nongeneric problems are described
C     in [6] and the TLS computations are generalized in order to solve
C     them. As proven in [6], the proposed generalization satisfies the
C     TLS criteria for any number L of observation vectors in B provided
C     that, in addition, the solution | X| is constrained to be
C                                     |-I|
C     orthogonal to all vectors of the form |w| which belong to the
C                                           |0|
C     space generated by the columns of the submatrix |Y|.
C                                                     |F|

C
C     NUMERICAL ASPECTS
C
C     The computational efficiency of the PTLS algorithm compared with
C     the classical TLS algorithm (see [2 - 5]) is obtained by making
C     use of PSVD (see [1]) instead of performing the entire SVD.
C     Depending on the gap between the RANK-th and the (RANK+1)-th
C     singular values of C, the number (N + L - RANK) of base vectors to
C     be computed with respect to the column dimension (N + L) of C and
C     the desired accuracy RELTOL, the algorithm used by this routine is
C     approximately twice as fast as the classical TLS algorithm at the
C     expense of extra storage requirements, namely:
C       (N + L) x (N + L - 1)/2  if M >= N + L or
C       M x (N + L - (M - 1)/2)  if M <  N + L.
C     This is because the Householder transformations performed on the
C     rows of C in the bidiagonalization phase (see Step 1) must be kept
C     until the end (Step 5).
