C     PURPOSE
C
C     To solve for X = op(U)'*op(U) either the stable non-negative
C     definite continuous-time Lyapunov equation
C                                   2
C        op(A)'*X + X*op(A) = -scale *op(B)'*op(B)                   (1)
C
C     or the convergent non-negative definite discrete-time Lyapunov
C     equation
C                                   2
C        op(A)'*X*op(A) - X = -scale *op(B)'*op(B)                   (2)
C
C     where op(K) = K or K' (i.e., the transpose of the matrix K), A is
C     an N-by-N matrix in real Schur form, op(B) is an M-by-N matrix,
C     U is an upper triangular matrix containing the Cholesky factor of
C     the solution matrix X, X = op(U)'*op(U), and scale is an output
C     scale factor, set less than or equal to 1 to avoid overflow in X.
C     If matrix B has full rank then the solution matrix X will be
C     positive-definite and hence the Cholesky factor U will be
C     nonsingular, but if B is rank deficient then X may only be
C     positive semi-definite and U will be singular.
C
C     In the case of equation (1) the matrix A must be stable (that
C     is, all the eigenvalues of A must have negative real parts),
C     and for equation (2) the matrix A must be convergent (that is,
C     all the eigenvalues of A must lie inside the unit circle).

C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The order of the matrix A and the number of columns in
C             matrix op(B).  N >= 0.

C             The leading N-by-N upper Hessenberg part of this array
C             must contain a real Schur form matrix S. The elements
C             below the upper Hessenberg part of the array A are not
C             referenced. The 2-by-2 blocks must only correspond to

C             eigenvalues).
C
C     LDA     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array A.  LDA >= MAX(1,N).
C
C     B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,N)
C             if LTRANS = .FALSE., and dimension (LDB,M), if
C             LTRANS = .TRUE..
C             On entry, if LTRANS = .FALSE., the leading M-by-N part of
C             this array must contain the coefficient matrix B of the
C             equation.
C             On entry, if LTRANS = .TRUE., the leading N-by-M part of
C             this array must contain the coefficient matrix B of the
C             equation.
C             On exit, if LTRANS = .FALSE., the leading
C             MIN(M,N)-by-MIN(M,N) upper triangular part of this array
C             contains the upper triangular matrix R (as defined in
C             METHOD), and the M-by-MIN(M,N) strictly lower triangular
C             part together with the elements of the array TAU are
C             overwritten by details of the matrix P (also defined in
C             METHOD). When M < N, columns (M+1),...,N of the array B
C             are overwritten by the matrix Z (see METHOD).
C             On exit, if LTRANS = .TRUE., the leading
C             MIN(M,N)-by-MIN(M,N) upper triangular part of
C             B(1:N,M-N+1), if M >= N, or of B(N-M+1:N,1:M), if M < N,
C             contains the upper triangular matrix R (as defined in
C             METHOD), and the remaining elements (below the diagonal
C             of R) together with the elements of the array TAU are
C             overwritten by details of the matrix P (also defined in
C             METHOD). When M < N, rows 1,...,(N-M) of the array B
C             are overwritten by the matrix Z (see METHOD).
C
C     LDB     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array B.
C             LDB >= MAX(1,M), if LTRANS = .FALSE.,
C             LDB >= MAX(1,N), if LTRANS = .TRUE..
C
C     TAU     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension (MIN(N,M))
C             This array contains the scalar factors of the elementary
C             reflectors defining the matrix P.
C
C     U       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension (LDU,N)
C             The leading N-by-N upper triangular part of this array
C             contains the Cholesky factor of the solution matrix X of
C             the problem, X = op(U)'*op(U).
C             The array U may be identified with B in the calling
C             statement, if B is properly dimensioned, and the
C             intermediate results returned in B are not needed.
C
C     LDU     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array U.  LDU >= MAX(1,N).
C
C     SCALE   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The scale factor, scale, set less than or equal to 1 to
C             prevent the solution overflowing.
C
C     Workspace
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, or INFO = 1, DWORK(1) returns the
C             optimal value of LDWORK.
C
C     LDWORK  INTEGER
C             The length of the array DWORK. LDWORK >= MAX(1,4*N).
C             For optimum performance LDWORK should sometimes be larger.
C
C             If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
C             routine only calculates the optimal size of the DWORK
C             array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
C             array, and no error message related to LDWORK is issued by
C             XERBLA.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value;
C             = 1:  if the Lyapunov equation is (nearly) singular
C                   (warning indicator);
C                   if DISCR = .FALSE., this means that while the matrix
C                   A has computed eigenvalues with negative real parts,
C                   it is only just stable in the sense that small
C                   perturbations in A can make one or more of the
C                   eigenvalues have a non-negative real part;
C                   if DISCR = .TRUE., this means that while the matrix
C                   A has computed eigenvalues inside the unit circle,
C                   it is nevertheless only just convergent, in the
C                   sense that small perturbations in A can make one or
C                   more of the eigenvalues lie outside the unit circle;
C                   perturbed values were used to solve the equation
C                   (but the matrix A is unchanged);
C             = 2:  if matrix A is not stable (that is, one or more of
C                   the eigenvalues of A has a non-negative real part),
C                   if DISCR = .FALSE., or not convergent (that is, one
C                   or more of the eigenvalues of A lies outside the
C                   unit circle), if DISCR = .TRUE.;
C             = 3:  if matrix A has two or more consecutive non-zero
C                   elements on the first sub-diagonal, so that there is
C                   a block larger than 2-by-2 on the diagonal;
C             = 4:  if matrix A has a 2-by-2 diagonal block with real
C                   eigenvalues instead of a complex conjugate pair.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The method used by the routine is based on the Bartels and
C     Stewart method [1], except that it finds the upper triangular
C     matrix U directly without first finding X and without the need
C     to form the normal matrix op(B)'*op(B) [2].
C
C     If LTRANS = .FALSE., the matrix B is factored as
C
C        B = P ( R ),  M >= N,   B = P ( R  Z ),  M < N,
C              ( 0 )
C
C     (QR factorization), where P is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix and
C     R is a square upper triangular matrix.
C
C     If LTRANS = .TRUE., the matrix B is factored as
C
C        B = ( 0  R ) P,  M >= N,  B = ( Z ) P,  M < N,
C                                      ( R )
C
C     (RQ factorization), where P is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix and
C     R is a square upper triangular matrix.
C
C     These factorizations are used to solve the continuous-time
C     Lyapunov equation in the canonical form
C                                                        2
C       op(A)'*op(U)'*op(U) + op(U)'*op(U)*op(A) = -scale *op(F)'*op(F),
C
C     or the discrete-time Lyapunov equation in the canonical form
C                                                        2
C       op(A)'*op(U)'*op(U)*op(A) - op(U)'*op(U) = -scale *op(F)'*op(F),
C
C     where U and F are N-by-N upper triangular matrices, and
C
C        F = R,                                  if M >= N, or
C
C        F = ( R ),    if LTRANS = .FALSE.,  or
C            ( 0 )
C
C        F = ( 0  Z ), if LTRANS = .TRUE.,       if M < N.
C            ( 0  R )
C
C     The canonical equation is solved for U.

C     FURTHER COMMENTS
C
C     The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular,
C     if A is only just stable (or convergent) then the Lyapunov
C     equation will be ill-conditioned. "Large" elements in U relative
C     to those of A and B, or a "small" value for scale, are symptoms
C     of ill-conditioning. A condition estimate can be computed using
C     SLICOT Library routine SB03MD.
