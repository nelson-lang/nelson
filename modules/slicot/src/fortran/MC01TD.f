      SUBROUTINE MC01TD( DICO, DP, P, STABLE, NZ, DWORK, IWARN, INFO )
C
C     PURPOSE
C
C     To determine whether or not a given polynomial P(x) with real
C     coefficients is stable, either in the continuous-time or discrete-
C     time case.
C
C     A polynomial is said to be stable in the continuous-time case
C     if all its zeros lie in the left half-plane, and stable in the
C     discrete-time case if all its zeros lie inside the unit circle.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Mode Parameters
C
C     DICO    CHARACTER*1
C             Indicates whether the stability test to be applied to
C             P(x) is in the continuous-time or discrete-time case as
C             follows:
C             = 'C':  Continuous-time case;
C             = 'D':  Discrete-time case.
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     DP      (input/output) INTEGER
C             On entry, the degree of the polynomial P(x).  DP >= 0.
C             On exit, if P(DP+1) = 0.0 on entry, then DP contains the
C             index of the highest power of x for which P(DP+1) <> 0.0.
C
C     P       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (DP+1)
C             This array must contain the coefficients of P(x) in
C             increasing powers of x.
C
C     STABLE  (output) LOGICAL
C             Contains the value .TRUE. if P(x) is stable and the value
C             .FALSE. otherwise (see also NUMERICAL ASPECTS).
C
C     NZ      (output) INTEGER
C             If INFO = 0, contains the number of unstable zeros - that
C             is, the number of zeros of P(x) in the right half-plane if
C             DICO = 'C' or the number of zeros of P(x) outside the unit
C             circle if DICO = 'D' (see also NUMERICAL ASPECTS).
C
C     Workspace
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*DP+2)
C             The leading (DP+1) elements of DWORK contain the Routh
C             coefficients, if DICO = 'C', or the constant terms of
C             the Schur-Cohn transforms, if DICO = 'D'.
C
C     Warning Indicator
C
C     IWARN   INTEGER
C             = 0:  no warning;
C             = k:  if the degree of the polynomial P(x) has been
C                   reduced to (DB - k) because P(DB+1-j) = 0.0 on entry
C                   for j = 0, 1,..., k-1 and P(DB+1-k) <> 0.0.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value;
C             = 1:  if on entry, P(x) is the zero polynomial;
C             = 2:  if the polynomial P(x) is most probably unstable,
C                   although it may be stable with one or more zeros
C                   very close to either the imaginary axis if
C                   DICO = 'C' or the unit circle if DICO = 'D'.
C                   The number of unstable zeros (NZ) is not determined.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The stability of the real polynomial
C                                         2                DP
C        P(x) = p(0) + p(1) * x + p(2) * x  + ... + p(DP) x
C
C     is determined as follows.
C
C     In the continuous-time case (DICO = 'C') the Routh algorithm
C     (see [1]) is used. The routine computes the Routh coefficients and
C     if they are non-zero then the number of sign changes in the
C     sequence of the coefficients is equal to the number of zeros with
C     positive imaginary part.
C
C     In the discrete-time case (DICO = 'D') the Schur-Cohn
C     algorithm (see [2] and [3]) is applied to the reciprocal
C     polynomial
C                                                2               DP
C        Q(x) = p(DP) + p(DP-1) * x + p(DP-2) * x  + ... + p(0) x  .
C
C     The routine computes the constant terms of the Schur transforms
C     and if all of them are non-zero then the number of zeros of P(x)
C     with modulus greater than unity is obtained from the sequence of
C     constant terms.

C
C     NUMERICAL ASPECTS
C
C     The algorithm used by the routine is numerically stable.
C
C     Note that if some of the Routh coefficients (DICO = 'C') or
C     some of the constant terms of the Schur-Cohn transforms (DICO =
C     'D') are small relative to EPS (the machine precision), then
C     the number of unstable zeros (and hence the value of STABLE) may
C     be incorrect.
