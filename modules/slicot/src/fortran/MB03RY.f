      SUBROUTINE MB03RY( M, N, PMAX, A, LDA, B, LDB, C, LDC, INFO )
C
C     PURPOSE
C
C     To solve the Sylvester equation -AX + XB = C, where A and B are
C     M-by-M and N-by-N matrices, respectively, in real Schur form.
C
C     This routine is intended to be called only by SLICOT Library
C     routine MB03RD. For efficiency purposes, the computations are
C     aborted when the infinity norm of an elementary submatrix of X is
C     greater than a given value PMAX.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     M       (input) INTEGER
C             The order of the matrix A and the number of rows of the
C             matrices C and X.  M >= 0.
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The order of the matrix B and the number of columns of the
C             matrices C and X.  N >= 0.
C
C     PMAX    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             An upper bound for the infinity norm of an elementary
C             submatrix of X (see METHOD).
C
C     A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,M)
C             The leading M-by-M part of this array must contain the
C             matrix A of the Sylvester equation, in real Schur form.
C             The elements below the real Schur form are not referenced.
C
C     LDA     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array A.  LDA >= MAX(1,M).
C
C     B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,N)
C             The leading N-by-N part of this array must contain the
C             matrix B of the Sylvester equation, in real Schur form.
C             The elements below the real Schur form are not referenced.
C
C     LDB     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array B.  LDB >= MAX(1,N).
C
C     C       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDC,N)
C             On entry, the leading M-by-N part of this array must
C             contain the matrix C of the Sylvester equation.
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, the leading M-by-N part of this
C             array contains the solution matrix X of the Sylvester
C             equation, and each elementary submatrix of X (see METHOD)
C             has the infinity norm less than or equal to PMAX.
C             On exit, if INFO = 1, the solution matrix X has not been
C             computed completely, because an elementary submatrix of X
C             had the infinity norm greater than PMAX. Part of the
C             matrix C has possibly been overwritten with the
C             corresponding part of X.
C
C     LDC     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array C.  LDC >= MAX(1,M).
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             = 1:  an elementary submatrix of X had the infinity norm
C                   greater than the given value PMAX.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The routine uses an adaptation of the standard method for solving
C     Sylvester equations [1], which controls the magnitude of the
C     individual elements of the computed solution [2]. The equation
C     -AX + XB = C can be rewritten as
C                                 p            l-1
C       -A  X   + X  B   = C   + sum  A  X   - sum  X  B
C         kk kl    kl ll    kl  i=k+1  ki il   j=1   kj jl
C
C     for l = 1:q, and k = p:-1:1, where A  , B  , C  , and X  , are
C                                         kk   ll   kl       kl
C     block submatrices defined by the partitioning induced by the Schur
C     form of A and B, and p and q are the numbers of the diagonal
C     blocks of A and B, respectively. So, the elementary submatrices of
C     X are found block column by block column, starting from the
C     bottom. If any such elementary submatrix has the infinity norm
C     greater than the given value PMAX, the calculations are ended.

C     FURTHER COMMENTS
C
C     Let
C
C            ( A   C )       ( I   X )
C        M = (       ),  Y = (       ).
C            ( 0   B )       ( 0   I )
C
C     Then
C
C         -1      ( A   0 )
C        Y  M Y = (       ),
C                 ( 0   B )
C
C     hence Y is an non-orthogonal transformation matrix which performs
C     the reduction of M to a block-diagonal form. Bounding a norm of
C     X is equivalent to setting an upper bound to the condition number
C     of the transformation matrix Y.
