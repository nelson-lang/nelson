C
C     PURPOSE
C
C     To preprocess the input-output data for estimating the matrices
C     of a linear time-invariant dynamical system and to find an
C     estimate of the system order. The input-output data can,
C     optionally, be processed sequentially.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Mode Parameters
C
C     METH    CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies the subspace identification method to be used,
C             as follows:
C             = 'M':  MOESP  algorithm with past inputs and outputs;
C             = 'N':  N4SID  algorithm.
C
C     ALG     CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies the algorithm for computing the triangular
C             factor R, as follows:
C             = 'C':  Cholesky algorithm applied to the correlation
C                     matrix of the input-output data;
C             = 'F':  Fast QR algorithm;
C             = 'Q':  QR algorithm applied to the concatenated block
C                     Hankel matrices.
C
C     JOBD    CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether or not the matrices B and D should later
C             be computed using the MOESP approach, as follows:
C             = 'M':  the matrices B and D should later be computed
C                     using the MOESP approach;
C             = 'N':  the matrices B and D should not be computed using
C                     the MOESP approach.
C             This parameter is not relevant for METH = 'N'.
C
C     BATCH   CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether or not sequential data processing is to
C             be used, and, for sequential processing, whether or not
C             the current data block is the first block, an intermediate
C             block, or the last block, as follows:
C             = 'F':  the first block in sequential data processing;
C             = 'I':  an intermediate block in sequential data
C                     processing;
C             = 'L':  the last block in sequential data processing;
C             = 'O':  one block only (non-sequential data processing).
C             NOTE that when  100  cycles of sequential data processing
C                  are completed for  BATCH = 'I',  a warning is
C                  issued, to prevent for an infinite loop.
C
C     CONCT   CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether or not the successive data blocks in
C             sequential data processing belong to a single experiment,
C             as follows:
C             = 'C':  the current data block is a continuation of the
C                     previous data block and/or it will be continued
C                     by the next data block;
C             = 'N':  there is no connection between the current data
C                     block and the previous and/or the next ones.
C             This parameter is not used if BATCH = 'O'.
C
C     CTRL    CHARACTER*1
C             Specifies whether or not the user's confirmation of the
C             system order estimate is desired, as follows:
C             = 'C':  user's confirmation;
C             = 'N':  no confirmation.
C             If  CTRL = 'C',  a reverse communication routine,  IB01OY,
C             is indirectly called (by SLICOT Library routine IB01OD),
C             and, after inspecting the singular values and system order
C             estimate,  n,  the user may accept  n  or set a new value.
C             IB01OY  is not called if CTRL = 'N'.
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     NOBR    (input) INTEGER
C             The number of block rows,  s,  in the input and output
C             block Hankel matrices to be processed.  NOBR > 0.
C             (In the MOESP theory,  NOBR  should be larger than  n,
C             the estimated dimension of state vector.)
C
C     M       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of system inputs.  M >= 0.
C             When M = 0, no system inputs are processed.
C
C     L       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of system outputs.  L > 0.
C
C     NSMP    (input) INTEGER
C             The number of rows of matrices  U  and  Y  (number of
C             samples,  t). (When sequential data processing is used,
C             NSMP  is the number of samples of the current data
C             block.)
C             NSMP >= 2*(M+L+1)*NOBR - 1,  for non-sequential
C                                          processing;
C             NSMP >= 2*NOBR,  for sequential processing.
C             The total number of samples when calling the routine with
C             BATCH = 'L'  should be at least  2*(M+L+1)*NOBR - 1.
C             The  NSMP  argument may vary from a cycle to another in
C             sequential data processing, but  NOBR, M,  and  L  should
C             be kept constant. For efficiency, it is advisable to use
C             NSMP  as large as possible.
C
C     U       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDU,M)
C             The leading NSMP-by-M part of this array must contain the
C             t-by-m input-data sequence matrix  U,
C             U = [u_1 u_2 ... u_m].  Column  j  of  U  contains the
C             NSMP  values of the j-th input component for consecutive
C             time increments.
C             If M = 0, this array is not referenced.
C
C     LDU     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of the array U.
C             LDU >= NSMP, if M > 0;
C             LDU >= 1,    if M = 0.
C
C     Y       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDY,L)
C             The leading NSMP-by-L part of this array must contain the
C             t-by-l output-data sequence matrix  Y,
C             Y = [y_1 y_2 ... y_l].  Column  j  of  Y  contains the
C             NSMP  values of the j-th output component for consecutive
C             time increments.
C
C     LDY     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of the array Y.  LDY >= NSMP.
C
C     N       (output) INTEGER
C             The estimated order of the system.
C             If  CTRL = 'C',  the estimated order has been reset to a
C             value specified by the user.
C
C     R       (output or input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
C             ( LDR,2*(M+L)*NOBR )
C             On exit, if ALG = 'C' and BATCH = 'F' or 'I', the leading
C             2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR upper triangular part of this
C             array contains the current upper triangular part of the
C             correlation matrix in sequential data processing.
C             If ALG = 'F' and BATCH = 'F' or 'I', the array R is not
C             referenced.
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, ALG = 'Q', and BATCH = 'F' or 'I',
C             the leading 2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR upper triangular
C             part of this array contains the current upper triangular
C             factor R from the QR factorization of the concatenated
C             block Hankel matrices. Denote  R_ij, i,j = 1:4,  the
C             ij submatrix of  R,  partitioned by M*NOBR,  M*NOBR,
C             L*NOBR,  and  L*NOBR  rows and columns.
C             On exit, if INFO = 0 and BATCH = 'L' or 'O', the leading
C             2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR upper triangular part of
C             this array contains the matrix S, the processed upper
C             triangular factor R from the QR factorization of the
C             concatenated block Hankel matrices, as required by other
C             subroutines. Specifically, let  S_ij, i,j = 1:4,  be the
C             ij submatrix of  S,  partitioned by M*NOBR,  L*NOBR,
C             M*NOBR,  and  L*NOBR  rows and columns. The submatrix
C             S_22  contains the matrix of left singular vectors needed
C             subsequently. Useful information is stored in  S_11  and
C             in the block-column  S_14 : S_44.  For METH = 'M' and
C             JOBD = 'M', the upper triangular part of  S_31  contains
C             the upper triangular factor in the QR factorization of the
C             matrix  R_1c = [ R_12'  R_22'  R_11' ]',  and  S_12
C             contains the corresponding leading part of the transformed
C             matrix  R_2c = [ R_13'  R_23'  R_14' ]'.  For  METH = 'N',
C             the subarray  S_41 : S_43  contains the transpose of the
C             matrix contained in  S_14 : S_34.
C             The details of the contents of R need not be known if this
C             routine is followed by SLICOT Library routine IB01BD.
C             On entry, if ALG = 'C', or ALG = 'Q', and BATCH = 'I' or
C             'L', the leading  2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR  upper
C             triangular part of this array must contain the upper
C             triangular matrix R computed at the previous call of this
C             routine in sequential data processing. The array R need
C             not be set on entry if ALG = 'F' or if BATCH = 'F' or 'O'.
C
C     LDR     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of the array  R.
C             LDR >= MAX( 2*(M+L)*NOBR, 3*M*NOBR ),
C                                  for METH = 'M' and JOBD = 'M';
C             LDR >= 2*(M+L)*NOBR, for METH = 'M' and JOBD = 'N' or
C                                  for METH = 'N'.
C
C     SV      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( L*NOBR )
C             The singular values used to estimate the system order.
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     RCOND   DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The tolerance to be used for estimating the rank of
C             matrices. If the user sets  RCOND > 0,  the given value
C             of  RCOND  is used as a lower bound for the reciprocal
C             condition number;  an m-by-n matrix whose estimated
C             condition number is less than  1/RCOND  is considered to
C             be of full rank.  If the user sets  RCOND <= 0,  then an
C             implicitly computed, default tolerance, defined by
C             RCONDEF = m*n*EPS,  is used instead, where  EPS  is the
C             relative machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
C             DLAMCH).
C             This parameter is not used for  METH = 'M'.
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             Absolute tolerance used for determining an estimate of
C             the system order. If  TOL >= 0,  the estimate is
C             indicated by the index of the last singular value greater
C             than or equal to  TOL.  (Singular values less than  TOL
C             are considered as zero.) When  TOL = 0,  an internally
C             computed default value,  TOL = NOBR*EPS*SV(1),  is used,
C             where  SV(1)  is the maximal singular value, and  EPS  is
C             the relative machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
C             DLAMCH). When  TOL < 0,  the estimate is indicated by the
C             index of the singular value that has the largest
C             logarithmic gap to its successor.
C
C     Workspace
C
C     IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (LIWORK)
C             LIWORK >= MAX(3,(M+L)*NOBR), if METH = 'N';

C             LIWORK >= 3,   if METH = 'M' and ALG = 'C' or 'Q'.
C             On entry with  BATCH = 'I'  or  BATCH = 'L',  IWORK(1:3)
C             must contain the values of ICYCLE, MAXWRK, and NSMPSM
C             set by the previous call of this routine.
C             On exit with  BATCH = 'F'  or  BATCH = 'I',  IWORK(1:3)
C             contains the values of ICYCLE, MAXWRK, and NSMPSM to be
C             used by the next call of the routine.
C             ICYCLE  counts the cycles for  BATCH = 'I'.
C             MAXWRK  stores the current optimal workspace.
C             NSMPSM  sums up the  NSMP  values for  BATCH <> 'O'.
C             The first three elements of  IWORK  should be preserved
C             during successive calls of the routine with  BATCH = 'F'
C             or  BATCH = 'I',  till the final call with   BATCH = 'L'.
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
C             On exit, if  INFO = 0,  DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
C             of LDWORK,  and, for  METH = 'N',  and  BATCH = 'L'  or
C             'O',  DWORK(2)  and  DWORK(3)  contain the reciprocal
C             condition numbers of the triangular factors of the
C             matrices  U_f  and  r_1  [6].
C             On exit, if  INFO = -23,  DWORK(1)  returns the minimum
C             value of LDWORK.
C             Let
C             k = 0,               if CONCT = 'N' and ALG = 'C' or 'Q';

C             k = 2*NOBR*(M+L+1),  if CONCT = 'N' and ALG = 'F';
C             k = 2*NOBR*(M+L+2),  if CONCT = 'C' and ALG = 'F'.
C             The first (M+L)*k elements of  DWORK  should be preserved
C             during successive calls of the routine with  BATCH = 'F'
C             or  'I',  till the final call with  BATCH = 'L'.

C     Warning Indicator
C

C
C     METHOD
C
C     The procedure consists in three main steps, the first step being
C     performed by one of the three algorithms included.
C
C     1.a) For non-sequential data processing using QR algorithm, a
C     t x 2(m+l)s  matrix H is constructed, where
C
C          H = [ Uf'         Up'      Y'      ],  for METH = 'M',
C                  s+1,2s,t    1,s,t   1,2s,t
C
C          H = [ U'       Y'      ],              for METH = 'N',
C                 1,2s,t   1,2s,t
C
C     and  Up     , Uf        , U      , and  Y        are block Hankel
C            1,s,t    s+1,2s,t   1,2s,t        1,2s,t
C     matrices defined in terms of the input and output data [3].
C     A QR factorization is used to compress the data.
C     The fast QR algorithm uses a QR factorization which exploits
C     the block-Hankel structure. Actually, the Cholesky factor of H'*H
C     is computed.
C
C     1.b) For sequential data processing using QR algorithm, the QR
C     decomposition is done sequentially, by updating the upper
C     triangular factor  R.  This is also performed internally if the
C     workspace is not large enough to accommodate an entire batch.
C
C     1.c) For non-sequential or sequential data processing using
C     Cholesky algorithm, the correlation matrix of input-output data is
C     computed (sequentially, if requested), taking advantage of the
C     block Hankel structure [7].  Then, the Cholesky factor of the
C     correlation matrix is found, if possible.
C
C     2) A singular value decomposition (SVD) of a certain matrix is
C     then computed, which reveals the order  n  of the system as the
C     number of "non-zero" singular values. For the MOESP approach, this
C     matrix is  [ R_24'  R_34' ]' := R(ms+1:(2m+l)s,(2m+l)s+1:2(m+l)s),
C     where  R  is the upper triangular factor  R  constructed by SLICOT
C     Library routine  IB01MD.  For the N4SID approach, a weighted
C     oblique projection is computed from the upper triangular factor  R
C     and its SVD is then found.
C
C     3) The singular values are compared to the given, or default TOL,
C     and the estimated order  n  is returned, possibly after user's
C     confirmation.

C
C     NUMERICAL ASPECTS
C
C     The implemented method is numerically stable (when QR algorithm is
C     used), reliable and efficient. The fast Cholesky or QR algorithms
C     are more efficient, but the accuracy could diminish by forming the
C     correlation matrix.
C     The most time-consuming computational step is step 1:
C                                        2
C     The QR algorithm needs 0(t(2(m+l)s) ) floating point operations.
C                                           2              3
C     The Cholesky algorithm needs 0(2t(m+l) s)+0((2(m+l)s) ) floating
C     point operations.
C                                          2           3 2
C     The fast QR algorithm needs 0(2t(m+l) s)+0(4(m+l) s ) floating
C     point operations.
C                                                3
C     Step 2 of the algorithm requires 0(((m+l)s) ) floating point
C     operations.
C
C     FURTHER COMMENTS
C
C     For ALG = 'Q', BATCH = 'O' and LDR < NS, or BATCH <> 'O', the
C     calculations could be rather inefficient if only minimal workspace
C     (see argument LDWORK) is provided. It is advisable to provide as
C     much workspace as possible. Almost optimal efficiency can be
C     obtained for  LDWORK = (NS+2)*(2*(M+L)*NOBR),  assuming that the
C     cache size is large enough to accommodate R, U, Y, and DWORK.
