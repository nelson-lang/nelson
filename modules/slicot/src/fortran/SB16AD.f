C     PURPOSE
C
C     To compute a reduced order controller (Acr,Bcr,Ccr,Dcr) for an
C     original state-space controller representation (Ac,Bc,Cc,Dc) by
C     using the frequency-weighted square-root or balancing-free
C     square-root Balance & Truncate (B&T) or Singular Perturbation
C     Approximation (SPA) model reduction methods. The algorithm tries
C     to minimize the norm of the frequency-weighted error
C
C           ||V*(K-Kr)*W||
C
C     where K and Kr are the transfer-function matrices of the original
C     and reduced order controllers, respectively. V and W are special
C     frequency-weighting transfer-function matrices constructed
C     to enforce closed-loop stability and/or closed-loop performance.
C     If G is the transfer-function matrix of the open-loop system, then
C     the following weightings V and W can be used:
C                      -1
C      (a)   V = (I-G*K) *G, W = I - to enforce closed-loop stability;
C                              -1
C      (b)   V = I,  W = (I-G*K) *G - to enforce closed-loop stability;
C                      -1              -1
C      (c)   V = (I-G*K) *G, W = (I-G*K)  - to enforce closed-loop
C            stability and performance.
C
C     G has the state space representation (A,B,C,D).
C     If K is unstable, only the ALPHA-stable part of K is reduced.

C             if ORDSEL = 'F', NCR is equal to

C     METHOD
C
C     Let K be the transfer-function matrix of the original linear
C     controller

C          u(t)     = Cc*xc(t) + Dc*y(t),                      (1)
C
C     where d[xc(t)] is dxc(t)/dt for a continuous-time system and
C     xc(t+1) for a discrete-time system. The subroutine SB16AD
C     determines the matrices of a reduced order controller
C
C          d[z(t)] = Acr*z(t) + Bcr*y(t)

C     such that the corresponding transfer-function matrix Kr minimizes
C     the norm of the frequency-weighted error
C
C             V*(K-Kr)*W,                                      (3)
C

C     chosen to enforce stability and/or performance of the closed-loop
C     system [3] (see description of the parameter WEIGHT).

C
C     1) Decompose additively K, of order NC, as
C
C          K = K1 + K2,
C
C        such that K1 has only ALPHA-stable poles and K2, of order NCU,
C        has only ALPHA-unstable poles.
C
C     2) Compute for K1 a B&T or SPA frequency-weighted approximation
C        K1r of order NCR-NCU using the frequency-weighted balancing
C        approach of [1] in conjunction with accuracy enhancing
C        techniques specified by the parameter JOBMR.
C
C     3) Assemble the reduced model Kr as
C
C           Kr = K1r + K2.
C
C     For the reduction of the ALPHA-stable part, several accuracy
C     enhancing techniques can be employed (see [2] for details).
C
C     If JOBMR = 'B', the square-root B&T method of [1] is used.
C
C     If JOBMR = 'F', the balancing-free square-root version of the
C     B&T method [1] is used.
C
C     If JOBMR = 'S', the square-root version of the SPA method [2,3]
C     is used.
C
C     If JOBMR = 'P', the balancing-free square-root version of the
C     SPA method [2,3] is used.
C
C     For each of these methods, two left and right truncation matrices
C     are determined using the Cholesky factors of an input
C     frequency-weighted controllability Grammian P and an output
C     frequency-weighted observability Grammian Q.
C     P and Q are determined as the leading NC-by-NC diagonal blocks
C     of the controllability Grammian of K*W and of the
C     observability Grammian of V*K. Special techniques developed in [2]
C     are used to compute the Cholesky factors of P and Q directly
C     (see also SLICOT Library routine SB16AY).
C     The frequency-weighted Hankel singular values HSVC(1), ....,
C     HSVC(NC) are computed as the square roots of the eigenvalues
C     of the product P*Q.
