C     PURPOSE
C
C     Calculates the (PWORK x MWORK) transfer matrix T(s), in the form
C     of polynomial row vectors over monic least common denominator
C     polynomials, of a given state-space representation (ssr).  Each
C     such row of T(s) is simply a single-output relatively left prime
C     polynomial matrix representation (pmr), so can be calculated by
C     applying a simplified version of the Orthogonal Structure
C     Theorem to a minimal ssr for the corresponding row of the given
C     system: such an ssr is obtained by using the Orthogonal Canon-
C     ical Form to first separate out a completely controllable one
C     for the overall system and then, for each row in turn, applying
C     it again to the resulting dual SIMO system.  The Orthogonal
C     Structure Theorem produces non-monic denominator and V:I(s)
C     polynomials: this is avoided here by first scaling AT (the
C     transpose of the controllable part of A, found in this routine)
C     by suitable products of its sub-diagonal elements (these are then
C     no longer needed, so freeing the entire lower triangle for
C     storing the coefficients of V(s) apart from the leading 1's,
C     which are treated implicitly).  These polynomials are calculated
C     in reverse order (IW = NMINL - 1,...,1), the monic denominator
C     D:I(s) found exactly as if it were V:0(s), and finally the
C     numerator vector U:I(s) obtained from the Orthogonal Structure
C     Theorem relation.
