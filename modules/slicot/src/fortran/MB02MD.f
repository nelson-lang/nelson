C     PURPOSE
C
C     To solve the Total Least Squares (TLS) problem using a Singular
C     Value Decomposition (SVD) approach.
C     The TLS problem assumes an overdetermined set of linear equations
C     AX = B, where both the data matrix A as well as the observation
C     matrix B are inaccurate. The routine also solves determined and
C     underdetermined sets of equations by computing the minimum norm
C     solution.
C     It is assumed that all preprocessing measures (scaling, coordinate
C     transformations, whitening, ... ) of the data have been performed
C     in advance.

C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Mode Parameters
C
C     JOB     CHARACTER*1
C             Determines whether the values of the parameters RANK and
C             TOL are to be specified by the user or computed by the
C             routine as follows:
C             = 'R':  Compute RANK only;
C             = 'T':  Compute TOL only;
C             = 'B':  Compute both RANK and TOL;
C             = 'N':  Compute neither RANK nor TOL.
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     M       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of rows in the data matrix A and the
C             observation matrix B.  M >= 0.
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of columns in the data matrix A.  N >= 0.
C
C     L       (input) INTEGER
C             The number of columns in the observation matrix B.
C             L >= 0.
C
C     RANK    (input/output) INTEGER
C             On entry, if JOB = 'T' or JOB = 'N', then RANK must
C             specify r, the rank of the TLS approximation [A+DA|B+DB].
C             RANK <= min(M,N).
C             Otherwise, r is computed by the routine.
C             On exit, if JOB = 'R' or JOB = 'B', and INFO = 0, then
C             RANK contains the computed (effective) rank of the TLS
C             approximation [A+DA|B+DB].
C             Otherwise, the user-supplied value of RANK may be
C             changed by the routine on exit if the RANK-th and the
C             (RANK+1)-th singular values of C = [A|B] are considered
C             to be equal, or if the upper triangular matrix F (as
C             defined in METHOD) is (numerically) singular.
C
C     C       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDC,N+L)
C             On entry, the leading M-by-(N+L) part of this array must
C             contain the matrices A and B. Specifically, the first N
C             columns must contain the data matrix A and the last L
C             columns the observation matrix B (right-hand sides).
C             On exit, the leading (N+L)-by-(N+L) part of this array
C             contains the (transformed) right singular vectors,
C             including null space vectors, if any, of C = [A|B].
C             Specifically, the leading (N+L)-by-RANK part of this array
C             always contains the first RANK right singular vectors,
C             corresponding to the largest singular values of C. If
C             L = 0, or if RANK = 0 and IWARN <> 2, the remaining
C             (N+L)-by-(N+L-RANK) top-right part of this array contains
C             the remaining N+L-RANK right singular vectors. Otherwise,
C             this part contains the matrix V2 transformed as described
C             in Step 3 of the TLS algorithm (see METHOD).
C
C     LDC     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array C.  LDC >= max(1,M,N+L).
C
C     S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N+L))
C             If INFO = 0, the singular values of matrix C, ordered
C             such that S(1) >= S(2) >= ... >= S(p-1) >= S(p) >= 0,
C             where p = min(M,N+L).
C
C     X       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,L)
C             If INFO = 0, the leading N-by-L part of this array
C             contains the solution X to the TLS problem specified
C             by A and B.
C
C     LDX     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             A tolerance used to determine the rank of the TLS
C             approximation [A+DA|B+DB] and to check the multiplicity
C             of the singular values of matrix C. Specifically, S(i)
C             and S(j) (i < j) are considered to be equal if
C             SQRT(S(i)**2 - S(j)**2) <= TOL, and the TLS approximation
C             [A+DA|B+DB] has rank r if S(i) > TOL*S(1) (or S(i) > TOL,
C             if TOL specifies sdev (see below)), for i = 1,2,...,r.
C             TOL is also used to check the singularity of the upper
C             triangular matrix F (as defined in METHOD).
C             If JOB = 'R' or JOB = 'N', then TOL must specify the
C             desired tolerance. If the user sets TOL to be less than or
C             equal to 0, the tolerance is taken as EPS, where EPS is
C             the machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).
C             Otherwise, the tolerance is computed by the routine and
C             the user must supply the non-negative value sdev, i.e. the
C             estimated standard deviation of the error on each element
C             of the matrix C, as input value of TOL.
C
C     Workspace
C
C     IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (L)
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
C             of LDWORK, and DWORK(2) returns the reciprocal of the
C             condition number of the matrix F.
C             If INFO > 0, DWORK(1:min(M,N+L)-1) contain the unconverged
C             non-diagonal elements of the bidiagonal matrix whose
C             diagonal is in S (see LAPACK Library routine DGESVD).
C
C     LDWORK  INTEGER
C             The length of the array DWORK.
C             LDWORK = max(2, 3*(N+L) + M, 5*(N+L)),       if M >= N+L;
C             LDWORK = max(2, M*(N+L) + max( 3M+N+L, 5*M), 3*L),
C                                                          if M <  N+L.
C             For optimum performance LDWORK should be larger.
C
C             If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed;
C             the routine only calculates the optimal size of the
C             DWORK array, returns this value as the first entry of
C             the DWORK array, and no error message related to LDWORK
C             is issued by XERBLA.
C
C     Warning Indicator
C
C     IWARN   INTEGER
C             = 0:  no warnings;
C             = 1:  if the rank of matrix C has been lowered because a
C                   singular value of multiplicity greater than 1 was
C                   found;
C             = 2:  if the rank of matrix C has been lowered because the
C                   upper triangular matrix F is (numerically) singular.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value;
C             > 0:  if the SVD algorithm (in LAPACK Library routine
C                   DBDSQR) has failed to converge. In this case, S(1),
C                   S(2), ..., S(INFO) may not have been found
C                   correctly and the remaining singular values may
C                   not be the smallest. This failure is not likely
C                   to occur.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The method used is an extension (see [3,4,5]) of the classical
C     TLS algorithm proposed by Golub and Van Loan [1].
C
C     Let [A|B] denote the matrix formed by adjoining the columns of B
C     to the columns of A on the right.
C
C     Total Least Squares (TLS) definition:
C     -------------------------------------
C
C       Given matrices A and B, find a matrix X satisfying
C
C            (A + DA) X = B + DB,
C
C       where A and DA are M-by-N matrices, B and DB are M-by-L matrices
C       and X is an N-by-L matrix.
C       The solution X must be such that the Frobenius norm of [DA|DB]
C       is a minimum and each column of B + DB is in the range of
C       A + DA. Whenever the solution is not unique, the routine singles
C       out the minimum norm solution X.
C
C     Define matrix C = [A|B] and s(i) as its i-th singular value for
C     i = 1,2,...,min(M,NL), where NL = N + L. If M < NL, then s(j) = 0
C     for j = M+1,...,NL.
C
C     The Classical TLS algorithm proceeds as follows (see [3,4,5]):
C
C     Step 1: Compute part of the singular value decomposition (SVD)
C             USV' of C = [A|B], namely compute S and V'. (An initial
C             QR factorization of C is used when M is larger enough
C             than NL.)
C
C     Step 2: If not fixed by the user, compute the rank r0 of the data
C             [A|B] based on TOL as follows: if JOB = 'R' or JOB = 'N',
C
C                s(1) >= ... >= s(r0) > TOL*s(1) >= ... >= s(NL).
C
C             Otherwise, using [2], TOL can be computed from the
C             standard deviation sdev of the errors on [A|B]:
C
C                TOL = SQRT(2 * max(M,NL)) * sdev,
C
C             and the rank r0 is determined (if JOB = 'R' or 'B') using
C
C                s(1) >= ... >= s(r0) > TOL >= ... >= s(NL).
C
C             The rank r of the approximation [A+DA|B+DB] is then equal
C             to the minimum of N and r0.
C
C     Step 3: Let V2 be the matrix of the columns of V corresponding to
C             the (NL - r) smallest singular values of C, i.e. the last
C             (NL - r) columns of V.
C             Compute with Householder transformations the orthogonal
C             matrix Q such that:
C
C                       |VH   Y|
C              V2 x Q = |      |
C                       |0    F|
C
C             where VH is an N-by-(N - r) matrix, Y is an N-by-L matrix
C             and F is an L-by-L upper triangular matrix.
C             If F is singular, then lower the rank r with the
C             multiplicity of s(r) and repeat this step.
C
C     Step 4: If F is nonsingular then the solution X is obtained by
C             solving the following equations by forward elimination:
C
C                X F = -Y.
C
C     Notes :
C     The TLS solution is unique if r = N, F is nonsingular and
C     s(N) > s(N+1).
C     If F is singular, however, then the computed solution is infinite
C     and hence does not satisfy the second TLS criterion (see TLS
C     definition). For these cases, Golub and Van Loan [1] claim that
C     the TLS problem has no solution. The properties of these so-called
C     nongeneric problems are described in [4] and the TLS computations
C     are generalized in order to solve them. As proven in [4], the
C     proposed generalization satisfies the TLS criteria for any
C     number L of observation vectors in B provided that, in addition,
C     the solution | X| is constrained to be orthogonal to all vectors
C                  |-I|
C     of the form |w| which belong to the space generated by the columns
C                 |0|
C     of the submatrix |Y|.
C                      |F|
