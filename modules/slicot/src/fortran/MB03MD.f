C
C     PURPOSE
C
C     To compute an upper bound THETA using a bisection method such that
C     the bidiagonal matrix
C
C              |q(1) e(1)  0    ...   0   |
C              | 0   q(2) e(2)        .   |
C          J = | .                    .   |
C              | .                  e(N-1)|
C              | 0   ...        ...  q(N) |
C
C     has precisely L singular values less than or equal to THETA plus
C     a given tolerance TOL.
C
C     This routine is mainly intended to be called only by other SLICOT
C     routines.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The order of the bidiagonal matrix J.  N >= 0.
C
C     L       (input/output) INTEGER
C             On entry, L must contain the number of singular values
C             of J which must be less than or equal to the upper bound
C             computed by the routine.  0 <= L <= N.
C             On exit, L may be increased if the L-th smallest singular
C             value of J has multiplicity greater than 1. In this case,
C             L is increased by the number of singular values of J which
C             are larger than its L-th smallest one and approach the
C             L-th smallest singular value of J within a distance less
C             than TOL.
C             If L has been increased, then the routine returns with
C             IWARN set to 1.
C
C     THETA   (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             On entry, THETA must contain an initial estimate for the
C             upper bound to be computed. If THETA < 0.0 on entry, then
C             one of the following default values is used.
C             If L = 0, THETA is set to 0.0 irrespective of the input
C             value of THETA; if L = 1, then THETA is taken as
C             MIN(ABS(Q(i))), for i = 1,2,...,N; otherwise, THETA is
C             taken as ABS(Q(N-L+1)).
C             On exit, THETA contains the computed upper bound such that
C             the bidiagonal matrix J has precisely L singular values
C             less than or equal to THETA + TOL.
C
C     Q       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             This array must contain the diagonal elements q(1),
C             q(2),...,q(N) of the bidiagonal matrix J. That is,
C             Q(i) = J(i,i) for i = 1,2,...,N.
C
C     E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
C             This array must contain the superdiagonal elements
C             e(1),e(2),...,e(N-1) of the bidiagonal matrix J. That is,
C             E(k) = J(k,k+1) for k = 1,2,...,N-1.
C
C     Q2      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             This array must contain the squares of the diagonal
C             elements q(1),q(2),...,q(N) of the bidiagonal matrix J.
C             That is, Q2(i) = J(i,i)**2 for i = 1,2,...,N.
C
C     E2      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
C             This array must contain the squares of the superdiagonal
C             elements e(1),e(2),...,e(N-1) of the bidiagonal matrix J.
C             That is, E2(k) = J(k,k+1)**2 for k = 1,2,...,N-1.
C
C     PIVMIN  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The minimum absolute value of a "pivot" in the Sturm
C             sequence loop.
C             PIVMIN >= max( max( |q(i)|, |e(k)| )**2*sf_min, sf_min ),
C             where i = 1,2,...,N, k = 1,2,...,N-1, and sf_min is at
C             least the smallest number that can divide one without
C             overflow (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).
C             Note that this condition is not checked by the routine.
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             This parameter defines the multiplicity of singular values
C             by considering all singular values within an interval of
C             length TOL as coinciding. TOL is used in checking how many
C             singular values are less than or equal to THETA. Also in
C             computing an appropriate upper bound THETA by a bisection
C             method, TOL is used as a stopping criterion defining the
C             minimum (absolute) subinterval width.  TOL >= 0.
C
C     RELTOL  DOUBLE PRECISION
C             This parameter specifies the minimum relative width of an
C             interval. When an interval is narrower than TOL, or than
C             RELTOL times the larger (in magnitude) endpoint, then it
C             is considered to be sufficiently small and bisection has
C             converged.
C             RELTOL >= BASE * EPS, where BASE is machine radix and EPS
C             is machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).
C
C     Warning Indicator
C
C     IWARN   INTEGER
C             = 0:  no warnings;
C             = 1:  if the value of L has been increased as the L-th
C                   smallest singular value of J coincides with the
C                   (L+1)-th smallest one.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     Let s(i), i = 1,2,...,N, be the N non-negative singular values of
C     the bidiagonal matrix J arranged so that s(1) >= ... >= s(N) >= 0.
C     The routine then computes an upper bound T such that s(N-L) > T >=
C     s(N-L+1) as follows (see [2]).
C     First, if the initial estimate of THETA is not specified by the
C     user then the routine initialises THETA to be an estimate which
C     is close to the requested value of THETA if s(N-L) >> s(N-L+1).
C     Second, a bisection method (see [1, 8.5]) is used which generates
C     a sequence of shrinking intervals [Y,Z] such that either THETA in
C     [Y,Z] was found (so that J has L singular values less than or
C     equal to THETA), or
C
C        (number of s(i) <= Y) < L < (number of s(i) <= Z).
C
C     This bisection method is applied to an associated 2N-by-2N
C     symmetric tridiagonal matrix T" whose eigenvalues (see [1]) are
C     given by s(1),s(2),...,s(N),-s(1),-s(2),...,-s(N). One of the
C     starting values for the bisection method is the initial value of
C     THETA. If this value is an upper bound, then the initial lower
C     bound is set to zero, else the initial upper bound is computed
C     from the Gershgorin Circle Theorem [1, Theorem 7.2-1], applied to
C     T". The computation of the "number of s(i) <= Y (or Z)" is
C     achieved by calling SLICOT Library routine MB03ND, which applies
C     Sylvester's Law of Inertia or equivalently Sturm sequences
C     [1, 8.5] to the associated matrix T". If
C
C        Z - Y <= MAX( TOL, PIVMIN, RELTOL*MAX( ABS( Y ), ABS( Z ) ) )
C
C     at some stage of the bisection method, then at least two singular
C     values of J lie in the interval [Y,Z] within a distance less than
C     TOL from each other. In this case, s(N-L) and s(N-L+1) are assumed
C     to coincide, the upper bound T is set to the value of Z, the value
C     of L is increased and IWARN is set to 1.
