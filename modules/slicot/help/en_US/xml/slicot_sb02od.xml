  <p>Solution of continuous- or discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations (generalized Schur vectors method)</p>
  <p>The routine uses the method of deflating subspaces, based on reordering the eigenvalues in a generalized Schur matrix pair.</p>
  <p>A standard eigenproblem is solved in the continuous-time case if G is given.</p>
