    >The SLICOT module provides advanced numerical algorithms for computations in systems and control theory.</p>
      <p
    >It includes tools for matrix factorization, system balancing, stability analysis, pole assignment, and solutions of Lyapunov, Riccati, and Sylvester equations.</p>
      <p
    >The module supports both continuous- and discrete-time systems, including descriptor and multi-input systems, enabling precise and efficient analysis, design, and control of complex dynamic systems.</p>
