        <p
    >The Modules Manager in Nelson provides the infrastructure to extend and manage the environment at runtime.</p>
        <p
    >It allows modules to be dynamically added, removed, and queried, making the system flexible and adaptable to different workflows.</p> 
        <p
    >With support for both internal and external modules, the manager handles module metadata, paths, and versioning.</p>
        <p
    >It also provides utilities for organizing user-defined toolboxes, managing gateways, and ensuring that dependencies are properly loaded.</p> 
        <p
    >This framework simplifies module distribution, integration, and maintenance, forming the backbone of Nelsonâ€™s modular architecture.</p>
