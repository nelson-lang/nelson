    >The Types module provides tools for managing and inspecting data types in Nelson.</p>
        <p
    >It allows users to query the nature of variables, distinguish between numeric, logical, string, and object types, and work with specialized types such as sparse or integer arrays.</p>
        <p
    >The module also supports creation of objects and validation of variable names, helping ensure type safety and consistency across scripts and functions.</p>
