 *     vector checker (like VectorCheck).
 *  2. Both A & B must be numeric
 *  3. Both A & B must be the same type.
 *  4. Both A & B must be 2-Dimensional.
 *  5. A & B must be conformant, i.e. the number of columns in A must
 *     match the number of rows in B.

/**
 * Check that both of the argument objects are of the
 * same type.  If not, computes conversion.  Here are the
 * rules:
 *   Float operations produce float results.
 *   Double operations produce double results.
 *   Mixtures of float and double operations produce double results.
 *   Integer operations (of any kind) produce int results -
 *     the question is what type do these objects get promoted too?  The
 *     answer is a signed int (64 bits).
 *   Mixtures of real and complex operations produce complex results.
 *   Integer constants are 32 bit by default
 *   Float constants are 64 bit by default
 *   Division operations lead to promotion
 *   Character types are automatically (demoted) to 32 bit integers.
 *
 *   The way to accomplish this is as follows: compute the larger
 *   of the types of A and B.  Call this type t_max.  If t_max
 *   is not an integer type, promote both types to this type.
 *   If t_max is an integer type, promote both objects to an NLS_INT64.
 *   If this is a division operation or a matrix operation, promote both
 *    objects to an NLS_DOUBLE!
