    >The Core module provides the fundamental building blocks of the Nelson environment.</p>
    <p
    >It includes essential services for program execution, environment management, and system interaction.</p>
    <p
    >Through this module, users can evaluate code dynamically, manage execution flow, query program state, and access key system information such as versioning, configuration, and licensing.</p>
    <p
    >It also offers basic utilities for file identification, checksums, and terminal capabilities.</p>
    <p
    >Together, these features form the foundation upon which all other modules and user-level functionality in Nelson are built.</p>
