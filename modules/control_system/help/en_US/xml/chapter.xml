      <p
    >The Control System module provides algorithms and tools for designing, analyzing, and tuning linear control systems in Nelson.</p>
      <p
    >It supports state-space and transfer function models, system transformations between continuous and discrete time, and computation of poles, zeros, and frequency responses.</p>
      <p
    >The module also includes functionality for system balancing, controllability and observability analysis, regulator and estimator design, and simulation of dynamic system responses.</p>
      <p
    >These tools enable robust modeling, analysis, and control of linear dynamic systems for engineering and research applications.</p>
