# Roadmap

The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the list below should give some indication of our plans for the next major release, and for the future.

Please feel free to file issues on this repository if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

### How can I help?

Short term objectives are listed above. Our goal is to split down the workload in such way that anybody can jump in and help.
Please comment on issues if you want to take it to avoid duplicating effort!
Similarly, if a maintainer is already assigned on an issue you'd like to participate in, pinging him on GitHub to offer your help is
the best way to go.

### How can I add something to the roadmap?

The roadmap process is new to Nelson: we are only beginning to structure and document the project objectives.
Our immediate goal is to be more transparent, and work with our community to
focus our efforts on fewer prioritized topics.
