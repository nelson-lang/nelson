The aim of Nelson is providing a powerful open computing environment for 
engineering and scientific applications using modern C/C++ libraries (Boost, Eigen, …)
and others state of art numerical libraries.
It has sophisticated data structures (including cell, struct, linear systems…),
an interpreter and a high level programming language.
Nelson has been developped to be an open/modular system where an user can define 
these own data types and operations on these data types by using overload.
