Nelson is an array programming language providing a powerful open computing environment for
engineering and scientific applications using modern C/C++ libraries (Boost, Eigen, …)
and others state of art numerical libraries.

It has sophisticated data structures (including cell, struct, linear systems, …),
an interpreter and a high level programming language.

Nelson has been developed to be an open/modular system where an user can define
these own data types and operations on these data types by using overload.
